Overdrafts.  The bank frowns on overdrafts.  In case of an overdraft, the bank returns the check unpaid and charges the account with a $20 overdraft fee.  The bank offers a protection for overdrafts.  Customers having Savings accounts can use them as backup to the checking accounts.  In this case, an overdraft will not occur if there is enough money in the savings account to cover the check.  The banking system will remove the correct amount of money from the savings account deposit it in the checking account and then honor the check.  This is done at no cost to the customer.  The customer must however specify the “overdraft” backup account.

3. Loans.  The bank maintains three different kinds of loan accounts;

a. The long term Mortgage loan.  This loan is of either the 15/30-year type.  These loans are fixed rate, fixed payment plan.  The bank receives these loans on a monthly basis.  If loan payment is late (beyond a given due date) the bank adds a $75 dollar late fee to that month’s payment.  Extra payments maybe made on loans at anytime, however no amount maybe added to the loan.  If a payment is missed, the account is flagged as a problem account.

b.  The short term loan.  This is a loan of approx. 5 years for things like cars.  The short-term loan has the same characteristics as the long-term loan. 

c. Credit Cards.  The bank has a credit card system it supports.  In this type of loan, debits against the loan are made with each credit card purchase.  For each CC account there is a limit on the credit available for that account.  So each purchase is checked to determine if it will bring the account balance over the limit.  If not the purchase (and the debit on the account) are authorized.  A record of each purchase is maintained.  CC bills are sent on the first of each month, payable by the 10’Th.  Each bill consists of a finance charge and a total of the charges incurred that month.  The account holder can pay the entire account off each month in which case there will be no finance charge.  Payments can be credited to the bill at anytime throughout the month.  The finance charge is calculated on the average balance of the bill through out the month.

ATM Cards.  Holders of accounts in the bank may have ATM cards for withdrawal.  ATM cards apply only to checking accounts and to simple savings accounts.  Holders are not allowed to withdraw more that the account is worth.  Further they are allowed to make no more than two ATM withdrawals per day.
